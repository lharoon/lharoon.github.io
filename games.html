        BeetleMania (2021)

        <p><i>BeetleMania</i> was my game design master’s project at <a href="http://gamedesign.university/">IULM
            University</a> in 2021. It’s a game about observation rather than direct participation. Within the context
          of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_fighting">beetle wrestling</a>, players are expected to make
          bets based on the results of past matches—for example, they may have noticed that the beetle with the purple
          gem is able to clone itself, which is particularly advantageous given the current matchup; or that in this
          arena smaller beetles are disadvantaged because of the pits that they can fall into. The pitch was <i>Robot
            Wars</i> (<i>BattleBots</i> if you’re American) x <i>Gang Beasts</i> x <i>Pokemon</i>. As it stands it’s
          more of a technical showcase than a functional game, being my first foray into 3D, AI, and the first time I’ve
          worked substantially with an artist. I hope to someday elaborate on the concept.</p>

        <p>You can play a slightly butchered version of the game in your web browser <a
            href="https://lharoon.itch.io/bugoutpt?secret=udiDkLVozyXiOok3NrX3TmkqSM">here</a> (the replay system
          doesn’t work in this build).</p>

        <p>A fully working Windows build is available <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AkRf7E1IUzqlfkpvUXTG5ktMtFNZ6bs8/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, and <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UX4KOEB_Ki06ZBMcExEObAni6BTWOtDF/view?usp=sharing">here</a> for
          macOS.</p>

        <p>Part infinite runner, part music video, <i>Swing Shot</i> is a one-button arcade game with a minimalist
          aesthetic. The aesthetic was the main driving force behind the design, informing the visuals, music, and
          gameplay. During production elements were added, then taken away. What’s left is a game about performing a
          single action well, with dwindling room for error the further you go.</p>

        Doubles (2018)

        <p>Although not my first Unity project, <i>Doubles</i> was by far my most polished and complete game to date in
          2017/2018. It’s <i>Pong</i>, but with two paddles per player and a radial playfield. These additions make for
          a more strategic game, with room for ‘backhands’ (where the inner paddle deflects the ball) and ‘slices’. More
          advanced moves include ‘smashes’ and ‘breaks’, which splits the ball into two! The original implementation was
          bogged down by finicky controls, but I plan to rectify that in a future release. </p>

        <p>You can download the original version <a href="https://lharoon.itch.io/doubles">here</a>.</p>
